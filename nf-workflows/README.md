# Sub-workflows

This repository contains the sub-workflows I've put together for my implicit workflow [`nf-pipelines`][nf_pipelines].
These have all been created for analyses that I require, so there is not specific pattern to what pipelines get written.
Modules used by these pipelines can be found at my modules library: [`nf-modules`][nf_modules].
